NumPy is an essential library for any scientific or numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and various mathematical functions that are efficient and easy to use. 
Basic array creation, arithmetic operations, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication are fundamental to working with NumPy.
NumPy has many of the features of Matlab, in a free, multiplatform program. It also allows you to do intensive computing operations in a simple way
Numeric Module: Array Constructors
ones, zeros, identity

Creating and Manipulating NumPy Arrays:
NumPy Array: 
It is the core object in NumPy for storing and manipulating numerical data. 
Arrays are more efficient and faster than lists for large datasets.
Indexing and Slicing: 
NumPy provides simple and efficient ways to access and manipulate elements in arrays using indexing and slicing.
Operations: 
NumPy supports element-wise operations, matrix operations, and advanced mathematical functions.
Boolean Indexing: 
Allows for filtering data based on specific conditions.
NumPy is an essential tool for numerical computing in Python, providing high-performance operations for scientific, engineering, and data science applications.
