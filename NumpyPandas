NumPy is an essential library for any scientific or numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and various mathematical functions that are efficient and easy to use. 
Basic array creation, arithmetic operations, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication are fundamental to working with NumPy.
NumPy has many of the features of Matlab, in a free, multiplatform program. It also allows you to do intensive computing operations in a simple way
Numeric Module: Array Constructors
ones, zeros, identity
arrayrange
LinearAlgebra Module: Solvers
Singular Value Decomposition
Eigenvalue, Eigenvector
Inverse
Determinant
Linear System Solver

Creating and Manipulating NumPy Arrays:
NumPy Array: 
It is the core object in NumPy for storing and manipulating numerical data. 
Arrays are more efficient and faster than lists for large datasets.
Indexing and Slicing: 
NumPy provides simple and efficient ways to access and manipulate elements in arrays using indexing and slicing.
Operations: 
NumPy supports element-wise operations, matrix operations, and advanced mathematical functions.
Boolean Indexing: 
Allows for filtering data based on specific conditions.
NumPy is an essential tool for numerical computing in Python, providing high-performance operations for scientific, engineering, and data science applications.



Creating NumPy Arrays


# You can create NumPy arrays using numpy.array() or using functions like numpy.zeros(), numpy.ones(), numpy.arange(), etc.
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("1D Array:", arr_1d)

# Creating a 2D array (Matrix)
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
print("2D Array:\n", arr_2d)

# Creating an array of zeros
arr_zeros = np.zeros((2, 3))  # 2x3 array of zeros
print("Zeros Array:\n", arr_zeros)

# Creating an array of ones
arr_ones = np.ones((3, 2))  # 3x2 array of ones
print("Ones Array:\n", arr_ones)

# Creating an array with a range of numbers
arr_range = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # Numbers from 0 to 10 with a step of 2
print("Range Array:", arr_range)
