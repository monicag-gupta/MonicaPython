NumPy is an essential library for any scientific or numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and various mathematical functions that are efficient and easy to use. 
Basic array creation, arithmetic operations, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication are fundamental to working with NumPy.
NumPy has many of the features of Matlab, in a free, multiplatform program. It also allows you to do intensive computing operations in a simple way
Numeric Module: Array Constructors
ones, zeros, identity
arrayrange
LinearAlgebra Module: Solvers
Singular Value Decomposition
Eigenvalue, Eigenvector
Inverse
Determinant
Linear System Solver

Creating and Manipulating NumPy Arrays:
NumPy Array: 
It is the core object in NumPy for storing and manipulating numerical data. 
Arrays are more efficient and faster than lists for large datasets.
Indexing and Slicing: 
NumPy provides simple and efficient ways to access and manipulate elements in arrays using indexing and slicing.
Operations: 
NumPy supports element-wise operations, matrix operations, and advanced mathematical functions.
Boolean Indexing: 
Allows for filtering data based on specific conditions.
NumPy is an essential tool for numerical computing in Python, providing high-performance operations for scientific, engineering, and data science applications.



Creating NumPy Arrays


# You can create NumPy arrays using numpy.array() or using functions like numpy.zeros(), numpy.ones(), numpy.arange(), etc.
import numpy as np

# Creating a 1D array
arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("1D Array:", arr_1d)

# Creating a 2D array (Matrix)
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
print("2D Array:\n", arr_2d)

# Creating an array of zeros
arr_zeros = np.zeros((2, 3))  # 2x3 array of zeros
print("Zeros Array:\n", arr_zeros)

# Creating an array of ones
arr_ones = np.ones((3, 2))  # 3x2 array of ones
print("Ones Array:\n", arr_ones)

# Creating an array with a range of numbers
arr_range = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # Numbers from 0 to 10 with a step of 2
print("Range Array:", arr_range)



_____________


# You can reshape NumPy arrays to change their dimensions without changing the underlying data.
# Reshaping a 1D array into a 2D array
import numpy as np


arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

arr_reshaped = arr_1d.reshape(2, 3)
print("Reshaped Array:\n", arr_reshaped)

# Output:
# Reshaped Array:
# [[1 2 3]
# [4 5 6]]

_________________


Create a 1D numpy array with numbers from 1 to 10, then create a 2D array with shape (3, 4).

import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
array_1d = np.arange(1, 11)
print("1D Array:", array_1d)

# Create a 2D array with shape (3, 4)
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
print("2D Array:")
print(array_2d)




_____________


Create a NumPy array with values ranging from 0 to 20 with a step of 2.
Find the shape and size of the array.
Reshape the array into a 5x2 matrix.


import numpy as np

# Create an array from 0 to 20 with a step of 2
array = np.arange(0, 20, 2)
print("Array:", array)

# Find the shape and size
print("Shape:", array.shape)
print("Size:", array.size)

# Reshape the array into a 5x2 matrix
reshaped_array = array.reshape(5, 2)
print("Reshaped Array:")
print(reshaped_array)



________________________


Create two 1D NumPy arrays, a and b.
Perform addition, subtraction, and element-wise multiplication.
Access and print the first element of a and the last element of b.



import numpy as np

# Create two arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])

# Operations
add_result = a + b
sub_result = a - b
mul_result = a * b

# Indexing
first_a = a[0]
last_b = b[-1]

print("Addition result:", add_result)
print("Subtraction result:", sub_result)
print("Multiplication result:", mul_result)
print("First element of a:", first_a)
print("Last element of b:", last_b)
