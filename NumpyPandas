NumPy is an essential library for any scientific or numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and various mathematical functions that are efficient and easy to use. 
Basic array creation, arithmetic operations, broadcasting, and matrix multiplication are fundamental to working with NumPy.
NumPy has many of the features of Matlab, in a free, multiplatform program. It also allows you to do intensive computing operations in a simple way
